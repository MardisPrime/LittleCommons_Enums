# LittleCommons_Enums

Java classes for working with enums.

An EnumStreamer is a Stream source made from a chosen enum's values.
It supports repeated streaming of the enum's values without repeated array creation via Enum.values().

EnumCollectors provides implementations of java.util.stream.Collector that accumulate enums into unmodifiable Sets and Maps backed by EnumSets and EnumMaps.
